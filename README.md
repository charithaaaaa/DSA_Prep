## 📅 The Plan

I will follow a topic-based approach, dedicating several days to mastering one key technique before moving to the next.

| Phase | Technique / Data Structure | Estimated Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | **Sliding Window** | 3 - 5 Days |
| **Phase 2** | Two Pointers | 3 Days |
| **Phase 3** | Recursion & Backtracking | 5 - 7 Days |
| **Phase 4** | Linked Lists & Stacks/Queues | 5 Days |
| **Phase 5** | Trees & Graphs (BFS/DFS) | 10 - 14 Days |
| **Phase 6** | Dynamic Programming | 7 - 10 Days |
