# ðŸ’» Sliding Window DSA Practice â€“ 20 Essential Problems

## ðŸš€ Day 1 of DSA Preparation

This repository tracks my progress in mastering the **Sliding Window Technique** in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This technique is crucial for optimizing problems involving **subarrays or substrings** to achieve an efficient $O(n)$ time complexity.

## ðŸ“˜ Sliding Window Overview ðŸªŸ

The core idea is to "slide" a window (defined by two pointers) across an array or string, reusing calculations from the previous step to avoid redundant computations.

| Feature | Description | Complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Time Complexity** | $O(n)$ â€” Each element enters and leaves the window once. |
| **Space Complexity** | $O(k)$ or $O(1)$, depending on data structures used (e.g., hash map, deque). |

## ðŸ§© Types of Sliding Windows

### 1. **Fixed-size Sliding Window**
Used when the window length **$k$ is constant**.
* **Mechanism:** Keep track of a running metric (e.g., sum) and update it by subtracting the element leaving the window and adding the element entering it.

### 2. **Variable-size Sliding Window**
Used to find the **longest/shortest** subarray/substring that satisfies a **specific condition**.
* **Mechanism:** Use two pointers (`left`, `right`). Expand with `right`. When the window violates the condition, contract with `left` until the condition is met again.

### 3. **Monotonic Deque-based Sliding Window**
Used to efficiently track the **maximum/minimum** element within the current window in $O(1)$ time.
* **Mechanism:** A `Deque` maintains indices of elements in a strictly **monotonic** (increasing or decreasing) order of their values.
